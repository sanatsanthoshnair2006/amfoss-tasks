THE TASK OF ADVENTURES (TASK 2)
------------------------------
Hi, my name is Sanat I would like to share my most enjoyable task that I done up till now.
That is the task 2 (Terminal Chaos).
You all must be wondering why I chose this task among the rest of the tasks.
The reason is it because it feels like I was playing a fantasy game where I have to use the linux commands(tools/weapons) which is used to clear several parts (quests) in the terminal.
The most enjoyable was to find the holy spell that is used in defeating Kharnok the Bloodforged(the boss).
Another one was to use the Celestial Veil Amulet in unlocking the chest which is like I was going on a treasure hunt.

TECHNICAL ASPECTS
-----------------
By doing the task 2 I learnt what linux truly is and how to use terminal effectively.
I now understand why people say that linux is user-friendly.
There are various commands there in linux and few of the ones that I studied are mentioned below. 
ls - List Directory Contents
cd - Change Directory
pwd - Print Working Directory
cp - Copy Files and Directories
mv - Move or Rename Files and Directories
rm - Remove Files and Directories
touch - Create an Empty File
cat - Concatenate and Display Files
echo - Display a Line of Text
grep - Search Text in Files
man - Display Manual Pages
nano - Text Editor
history - Command History
find - Search for Files and Directories

I also studied various git commands like
git clone - Clone a Repository
git add - Stage Changes for Commit
git status - Check the Status of the Working Directory
git commit - Commit Staged Changes
git push - Push Changes to a Remote Repository
git branch - Manage Branches
git checkout - Switch Branches or Restore Files
git config - Configure Git Settings

These are all the cool stuff I learned while doing the task 2.
I recommend this task to those people who struggle in learning linux commands and make it a lot easier to understand it rather byhearting it.
